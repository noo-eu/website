		<h1 class="text-center text-6xl">Europe, it's Time to Take Back Control</h1>
		<p>
			The world has changed. The digital foundations of our societies, the tools we use to communicate, to run our businesses and governments, are built on infrastructure controlled by corporations far beyond our borders. American giants, backed by an increasingly unstable political regime, hold the keys to Europe's digital future.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is not just about business. It's about sovereignty. It's about freedom.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every morning, you wake up and check your emails on Gmail. You sign in to work, on your Microsoft account. You store your files on Dropbox. You do your shopping on Amazon. You chat with friends on WhatsApp, plan your projects on Trello, and end the day watching Netflix. All of this, while mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and TikTok.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every interaction, every task, every moment of modern life flows through systems that are not accountable to us. At every step, we surrender more control, more privacy, more autonomy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The consequences are no longer hypothetical - they are real, tangible, and escalating:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Surveillance:</strong> foreign governments and corporations have access to our most sensitive personal and professional data. The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act">U.S. CLOUD Act</a> forces American companies to hand over data, no matter where it is stored, while the NSA surveillance programs continue unchecked. Our privacy is an illusion.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Censorship:</strong> platforms driven by foreign interests control what we see, what we read, what we think. Algorithms, driven by profits and politics, prioritize outrage and silence dissent. Facts are optional. Dialogue is dead.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dependence:</strong> European businesses, from startups to enterprises, rely on platforms that can change terms, hike prices, or even cut access overnight. Our entire infrastructure is one corporate decision away from chaos.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Vulnerability:</strong> critical infrastructure, including healthcare, education, and public administration, runs on foreign platforms, exposing entire systems to political and economic leverage. What happens when access is denied? When geopolitical tensions turn services into weapons? We are exposed, defenseless and dispensable.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We are not people, we are products. Captive participants in a system designed to extract profit and power from every interaction. The digital world, once a promise of freedom and innovation, has become a landscape of exploitation and control.
		</p>
		<h2 class="text-4xl">
			Europe Deserves Better. We Deserve Better.
		</h2>
		<p>
			We are building a new digital ecosystem - independent, ethical, European.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are building <span class="noo">noo</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A foundation for our communication, our businesses and societies, free from the control of foreign corporations and unstable regimes. No surveillance capitalism. No data exploitation.
		</p>
		<p>
			This isn't the latest startup chasing venture capital. <span class="noo">noo</span> is a movement to reclaim our digital sovereignty. We‚Äôre creating tools for work, collaboration, and life: email, cloud storage, communication, productivity. All built and hosted in Europe, by people who care.
		</p>
	
		<h2>
			Like the idea of unpaid, underappreciated work with no guarantee of success?
			<div class="text-xl">You‚Äôll fit right in.</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			We‚Äôre not offering stock options or six-figure salaries. What you will find is a chance to build something that matters. To be part of the team that ends Europe‚Äôs digital servitude and creates a future where technology serves people, not profit.
		</p>
		<p class="bg-eu-blue rounded text-white p-4 text-sm">
			Yes. There is a plan to help you put food on the table. And maybe even a t-shirt or mug with our logo. Oh, and you'll get a say in how we run things, and a share of the profits. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whatever your skills, there's a place for you at <span class="noo">noo</span>:
